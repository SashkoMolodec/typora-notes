## Cloud Computing Software Architecture Patterns

**Benefits** of Cloud Computing Pattern:

- Access to (virtually) infinite:

  - Computation
  - Storage
  - Network

  Infrastructure as a Service (**IaaS**)

- Without the IaaS every company would have to hire specialists and build infrastructure

- Cloud's pricing model charges **only** for services we use and hardware we reserve

- Removes entry barrier for new companies

- Tools/features to improve: 

  - Performance
  - Scalability
  - Reliability

  For example multi-region, multi-zone  deployment

Two major **disadvantages**:

- We don't own our system's infrastructure
- Cloud infrastructure is out of our direct control

### Scalability Patterns
