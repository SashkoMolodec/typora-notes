| Sort method                                                  | Complexity     | S or U                   | Comment                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :one: [Bubble Sort](data structure and algorithms course deep dive/sort methods/1_bubble_sort) | O(n^2)         |                          | Algorithm degrades quickly                                   |
| :two: [Selection Sort](data structure and algorithms course deep dive/sort methods/2_selection_sort) | O(n^2)         | Unstable                 | Doesn't require as much swapping as bubble sort              |
| :three: [Insertion Sort](data structure and algorithms course deep dive/sort methods/3_insertion_sort) | O(n^2)         | Stable                   | Usually performs about half as many comparisons as selection sort |
| :four: [Shell Sort](data structure and algorithms course deep dive/sort methods/4_shell_sort) | O(n^2)         | Unstable                 | Variation of Insertion sort (doesn't require as much shifting so usually performs better) |
| :five: [Merge Sort](data structure and algorithms course deep dive/sort methods/5_merge_sort) | O(nlogn)       | Stable                   | Recursive algorithm                                          |
| :six: [Quick Sort (Single pivot & Dual pivot)](data structure and algorithms course deep dive/sort methods/6_quick_sort) | O(nlogn)       | Unstable                 | Quicksort is the preferred algorithm over Mergesort, that requires O(n) extra storage, which makes it quite expensive for arrays |
| :seven: [Counting Sort](data structure and algorithms course deep dive/sort methods/7_counting_sort) | O(n)           | Extra steps to be stable | Can achieve this because we're making assumptions about the data we're sorting |
| :eight: [Radix Sort](data structure and algorithms course deep dive/sort methods/8_radix_sort) | O(n)           |                          | Assumption about the data, sort based on each individual digit or letter position |
| :nine: [Bucket Sort](data structure and algorithms course deep dive/sort methods/9_bucket_sort) | O(n)           |                          | Assumption about the data, uses hashing                      |
| :one::zero: [Heap Sort](data structure and algorithms course deep dive/sort methods/10_heap_sort) | worst O(nlogn) |                          |                                                              |
