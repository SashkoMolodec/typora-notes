## Cloud Native in Action

The main properties of cloud native applications:

- *Scalability*
- *Loose coupling*
- *Resilience*
- *Observability* - inferring the internal state of an application from its external outputs
- *Manageability* - changing the internal state and outputs via external inputs. In this and previous case, the application artifact is never changes, it's immutable
