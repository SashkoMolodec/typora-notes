> As a result of not defined or not properly defined process of clarifying requirements before providing estimates, the team might not have a possibility to analyze new requirements, leading to providing incorrect estimates.



The estimation process is set up, followed, and involves mandatory participation of the engineering team in the estimation process.

> As a result of not defined or not properly defined process of the engineering team involvement in the estimation process, not all team members might have a possibility to discuss new requirements, leading to providing incorrect estimates.



The estimation process is set up, followed, and involves mandatory and immediate stakeholders notifications about estimates' changes.

> As a result of not defined or not properly defined process of stakeholders notifications about estimates' changes, the actual status of development progress might differ from customer expectations and plans, leading to possible delays in schedule and a negative impact on customer satisfaction.



#### SOURCE CODE MANAGEMENT

The source code management process is set up and followed, and this process includes branching strategy documenting and sharing it with all team members.

> As a result of not defined or not properly defined process of branching strategy documenting and sharing it with all team members, the team won't know how branching strategy is built and spend additional time for finding a way to work with branches, leading to negatively impacted release schedule.



The development process is set up, followed, and obligates storing project-related scripts (configuration, build, deployment, and database upgrade) inside source control.

> As a result of not defined or not properly defined process of assuring how everyone stores project-related scripts correctly, scripts might be stored in inappropriate places for review and update, leading to negatively impacted product maintenance and build activities and decreasing code review efficiency.



The development process is set up, followed, and obligates version control system process set up and following, and includes a convention for commit message structure (message must be created with descriptive wording, track a related work item ID, and so on) that is obligatory for every commit in the repository.

> As a result of not defined or not properly defined process of following proper commit message structure, version control commits are not informative enough, leading to decreasing historical code review efficiency and future issues troubleshooting.
